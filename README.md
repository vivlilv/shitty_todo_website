The goal of making this site is to practice my JS skills, in this project I mainly used some event listeners,
also DOMContentLoaded to do everything else after the site is finished rendering itself,
also I used localStorage to have my tasks stored for the duration of the session.

I wanted to practice building from 0 my HTML and CSS but I simply don't know how to build my architercture on HTML yet, that is painful to acknowledge, but it is true. 
So first commit is something like a frankenstein that works because i put some logic but also used chatGPT to help me.

In the future I plan to add sending those tasks to notion page and posting them, no optimization, just so it works...

I am not making it useful right now, I just want to have the functionality and practice my skills. 
I fucked up when creating first repo, so I deleted it and created this one, just to push this crap, but enough negatives...
It works, I built most of it, and without this step I would not start learning React.+ it made me realise I need to learn fucking html and css to create my page structure more or less.
